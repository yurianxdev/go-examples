# gRPC with Golang

This repo implements different types of gRPC calls including *Stream* and *Unary* ones.

Although each microservice contains its client in the same folder, this could be applied (that's the actual purpose behind **gRPC**) between services located in different instances or infrastructure.

> Would be great implementing a gRPC server with **gRPC Gateway**
